## Project Overview

APT-UTC is a next-generation decentralized freelance platform built on the Aptos blockchain. It empowers clients and freelancers to collaborate transparently, securely, and efficiently, leveraging smart contracts for milestone-based payments, escrow, and trustless interactions. The platform is designed for the future of work in the Web3 era, with a focus on security, automation, and community-driven growth.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Decentralized Job Posting:** Clients can post jobs with detailed requirements, milestones, and deadlines. All job data is stored on-chain and/or IPFS for transparency and immutability.
- **Milestone Management:** Each job is divided into milestones with individual deadlines and escrowed payments, ensuring fair progress tracking and risk mitigation for both parties.
- **Escrow & Staking:** Funds for milestones are locked in a secure on-chain escrow. Workers must stake tokens to apply, aligning incentives and reducing spam applications.
- **Application & Approval Flow:** Workers apply by staking tokens. Clients review and approve candidates. Unsuccessful or expired applications allow workers to withdraw their stake.
- **Automated Fund Distribution:** Upon milestone completion and approval, funds are automatically released to the worker. In case of disputes or inactivity, the contract enforces fair fund splits and refunds.
- **Timeout & Dispute Handling:** If a milestone deadline passes without action, the contract allows for timeout claims, worker removal, or job reopening, all governed by transparent rules.

### Real-time Communication
- **Live Chat System:** Built with Firebase Firestore for real-time messaging between clients and workers
- **Message Status Tracking:** Sent, delivered, and read status indicators
- **User Presence:** Real-time online/offline status with last seen timestamps
- **Message Recall:** Users can recall their own messages with confirmation dialogs
- **Conversation Management:** Hide conversations without deleting data

## DeFi Vision & Future Integration

This project is designed with DeFi principles at its core:

- **Escrow Yield Generation:** Funds locked in job escrow can be deployed into DeFi protocols to earn yield while jobs are in progress
- **Staking Rewards:** Worker stake pools can be used for liquidity mining or yield farming
- **Fee Sharing & Platform Sustainability:** A portion of the yield or transaction fees can be distributed to platform stakeholders
- **Programmable Money Flows:** All fund movements are governed by smart contracts, enabling future integrations with lending, insurance, or reputation-based DeFi modules
